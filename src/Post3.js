          <p className="summary">Shares of Cava Group (CAVA -8.32%), the fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain and recent IPO, were soaring this week after the quiet period following the company's IPO expired, allowing analysts from the underwriting investment banks to issue ratings on the stock.

Not surprisingly, most of the commentary, which came out on Monday, was positive, and the stock was up 20.3% for the week as of Thursday's market close, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
